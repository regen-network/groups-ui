# Local Setup

1. `yarn install`
2. copy over the config `cp .env.local.example .env.local` and set any missing variables
3. `yarn dev` to run the repo
4. (optional) `yarn storybook` to see component examples

## Install Regen Ledger

`make install-local-ledger` - this will install the regen ledger binary to `local-ledger/regen` in order to be used by other makefile commands. Note: this will wipe any existing local regen ledger data

## Makefile commands

Run the following in order for initial project setup, then re-run to wipe local ledger data

1. `make local-clean` - wipe prior local ledger data
2. `make local-init` - set up local ledger, user wallets / accounts, seed funds
3. `make local-start` - run local node
4. `make bank-send` - send funds to the wallet address listed below

## Keplr

You'll need to import generated wallet info into Keplr in order to test features:

(from `USER` in the makefile)

## IDE

If you're using VSCode, it's recommended you install the eslint + prettier extensions and copy over the suggested workspace settings:

```sh
cp .vscode/settings.suggested.json .vscode/settings.json
```

# Architecture

## Code Structure

This project is organized by [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) principals for UI components:

```
ðŸ“¦src
 â”£ ðŸ“‚components
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚atoms - elements which can't be reduced to something simpler
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œindex.ts
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚molecules - collection of atoms
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚organisms - more complex elements made up of atoms, molecules, and (sometimes) other organisms
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚templates - viewport positioning and layout
 â”— ðŸ“‚pages - implementations of templates
```

Some relevant notes / Highlights:

- Outer padding and margin should be set by parents components - ie, an `Atom` should not have `margin` set on the outer element - instead, it would be set by its parent component
- `Atoms` have `index.ts` barrel files for convenience (ie `import { Box, Button } from '@/atoms'`), but`Molecules`, `Organisms`, `Templates`, and `Pages` do not. This is to avoid circular imports which can impact code splitting

## Types

Ledger calls & typescript types are generated using [telescope](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/telescope), and reside in [another package](https://github.com/haveanicedavid/cosmos-groups-ts)

- Because queries are currently handled through REST / LCD clients, property values are `camel_case` - this means the types used in this project won't work on RPC clients (relevant cosmos-sdk [issue](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/8055))
- Some types are manually combined / modified to ease the use in UI. These are prefixed with `UI` (e.g. the `UIGroup` type represnts a sdk `ChainInfo` with typed `metadata` which the UI creates)

## Library Resources

- [Chakra](https://chakra-ui.com/) - UI Components
- [Valtio](https://valtio.pmnd.rs/) and [Jotai](https://jotai.org/) - global state
- [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4) - API calls / Query caching
- [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) - form validation

## Linting

`yarn lint` - format with Prettier, fix linting errors
